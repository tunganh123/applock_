## Installation

### CocoaPods
```
pod 'MBSPasswordView'
```

### Carthage

MBSPasswordView is available through [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage). To install
it, simply add the following line to your Cartfile:
```
github "mayckonx/MBSPasswordView"
```

## How to Use
1. Import the framework
```swift
import MBSPasswordView
```

2. Go to your Storyboard/XIB -> Identity Inspector and change your UIView class and module to:
```swift
MBSPasswordView
```

3. Create an outlet and link it to your view as a MBSPasswordView.
```swift
@IBOutlet weak var passwordView: MBSPasswordView!
```

4. Implement the protocol to get the password result.
```swift
extension ViewController: MBSPasswordDelegate {
     func password(_ result: [String]) { // optional
        print("Password:\(result)")
    }
    func passwordFromBiometrics(_ result: Result<[String]>) { // optional
        print("Result:\(result)")
    }
}
```

5. Set the delegate in your viewDidLoad
```swift
  override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()
        
       passwordView?.delegate = self
       passwordView?.titleToRequestAuthentication = "Please, identify your self!"
       passwordView?.start(enableBiometrics: true)
    }
```

If you want, you can also check if the device supports FaceID/TouchID using:
```swift
passwordView?.isTouchIDAvailable()
passwordView?.isFaceIDAvailable()
```

That's it. If you enable biometrics, you get the password and automatically request the TouchID/FaceID every time. You just need to pass enableBiometrics: true on the start method.
üòé
It's done brah! 

You can customize the view. In the sample you can see how to access the properties and change it to your preferences. 

## Next improvments
1. Support 6 digits
2. Different kind of animations
